//STEP 4
void setupLights() {
  //translate origin upwards by 3/4 of the room's height 
  //create spotlight here with the following features:
  /* dim yellow lighting
     positioned at the translated origin
     direction downwards 
     cone angle of 30 degrees
     concentration of 1
     */    
}

//STEP 5a
//modify above spotlight direction such that it rotates around its downward direction
// use sinusoidal functions based on frameCount for its x- and z- directions 
//(HINT: you can slow down the rotation by dividing frameCount by a number)
